<Intro text="What do a dummy account and a thief have in common? They both have this black mask that covers their faces. A mask that will hide their identities for a while."/>

Dati kasi, back when I was a junior high school, I did a very dumb thing online. Using my personal Facebook account, I posted something that expressed disappointment towards the governor of my area as he did not suspended the class despite the bad weather.

Unlucky me, pinagalitan ako isa-isa ng mga kamag-anak ko, whahahahahaha. Talk about a very bad day.

Now, I do understand some people, especially teens, kung bakit nila kinakailangang gumawa ng panibagong account. Kasi although virtual world is a great space for ideas and interactions, as long as you do have some of your relatives that is quite conservative or do have views against yours, self-expression will be deemed impossible—unless you don't mind getting an unlimited "bunganga moments" with them.

<H text="The Bright Side"/>

Anonymity. It is when you can be branded as "anonymous" or "unknown". Walang makakakilala sa'yo since your surroundings are considered strangers.

And because they are strangers, you are free to show yourself—self-expression is also not deprived. Extroverted ka man or introverted, I know na napakagandang space ang Internet to do such thing.

Aside from this, we also have a Role Play World (RPW). Isa siyang special place sa isang social media site, wherein, as the name of the world suggests, roleplays their selected known personalities, mapa-animated man o real life. Gamit na gamit ito ng mga teenagers ranging from 12 - 20 years old.

To be honest, I'm one of the roleplayers in Facebook. Nag-start ako ng 2020, and if you are curious on why—'eto kasi 'yun. Initially, I just want to go there to meet some friends, then me, as someone whose thirst in love (yak), thirsts in love. Ngayon, ginagamit ko na 'yung account na 'yun for shitposts and whatnots.

These virtual accounts surely give us the opportunity too to create something new upon ourselves—alter ego raw (Tagalog 'yung last word hahahahaha). I just really love the fact na gustung-gusto nating i-unleash ang mga bagay na meron pala sa atin, but we can't due to some na nagsu-supress sa mga ito. Sad but that's the reality.

The same thing goes when we are also creating a page, especially in Facebook, wherein we can release anything that we love to share to the people. Sa FB pages kasi, as a creator of it, you are free to ban, or uninvite some people among your friendlist, so talagang filtered na filtered lang 'yung target audience mo. Ipagpray mo na lang na walang dummy or RPW account ang mga nasa "avoided list" mo na nakalike sa page mo, hahahahaha.

Despite all the good things na hatid ng anonymity, ang dami namang umaabuso rito. 
According pala kay <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1139972/share-of-facebook-users-by-age-philippines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20about,share%20of%20over%2090%20percent.">Statista.com</a>, as of December 2022, nangunguna ang Facebook bilang platform ng mga Pinoy in terms of social interaction, wherein 30.5% of its users na nakabase sa bansa natin ay ranging from 18 to 24.

Hindi naman ito nakapagtataka kasi kahit wala kang data allowance, you can access the said site through its free data feature (formally called as basic mode). 

With that said, it's a hotspot for trolls. Mag-comment ka lang ng something annoying or going against the post, maraming ma-ooffend. May bonus ka pang death o "bugbog" threat through private chat.

You can also use anonymity in Facebook by creating a page, and adding a profile picture with an unbelievable caption. Maraming gullible individuals ang siguradong mangba-bash sa'yo to the point na maraming magshe-share, mag-e-angry react at magko-comment dito. Congratulations, you made a clout-chasing move, you epal!

On serious note, trolls are type of people na 'di nagtatago sa pekeng accounts (or sometimes, they do). Pero ang mga nakabwi-bwisit na uri ng accounts ay 'yung galing sa RPW—no joke!

Masyado na nilang ginagamit ang kagandahang hatid ng anonymity para magratify ang sarili nila, while depriving other people virtually. 

I usually see some in which just because they are using such account, they are permitted to use the n-word. Some will make a post stating that they love sex (or love is all about sex); eh, obvious namang minor pa siya.

I just hate these accounts posting statuses which are unethical, immoral and non-inclusive. Kung pwede lang silang sikmurahan virtually, siguro nagawa ko na nang ilang beses. 

Knowing that majority of RP accounts are operated by adolescents, this is somehow alarming that they use a beautiful part of the platform for relentless and merciless ideologies. 

Oy, ano pala ... hindi lang sa FB nagkakaroon ng RPW, it can be seen through different social media sites. 'Yun lang naman; dinagdag ko lang, for your knowledge. 

Naalala ko tuloy 'yung mga pinagsasagot kong mga threaders sa RPW noon na nagpo-post ng mga threads na wala man lang kasayte-citation, amp. Kakagigil, eh!

<H text="And Now, the Answer"/>

Long story short, bakit nga ba ang lakas-lakas ng loob natin kapag 'di tayo nakikilala sa virtual world?

Kasi walang mangdya-judge sa anumang i-eexpress natin online. 

Wala, kahit sinuman, ang magagalit sa'yo kapag nag-post ka ng pagkadismaya sa gobernador niyo kapag 'di siya nagkansela ng klase kahit Signal No. 2 na ang lugar niyo.

In short, you are free to express yourself. 

Pero sana naman, please lang, pakigamit ang Internet sa tamang bagay. Sa dami ba naman na ginawa ng mga pusa ko rito sa bahay tulad ng nasa baba:

<Img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/931746972300374077/1094130289401405530/IMG_20230314_083211.jpg"/>

Hahaha, nag-flex lang ako ng mga pusa, sorry.

Back to this blug, ayun nga ... huwag sana nating gamitin ang anonymity upang manlamang o makasakit ng ibang tao. Ang daming hatid na benepisyo nito sa ating mga netizen na baka hindi ko pa nailalagay dito sa blug na'to. 

But take note that by being anonymous, you can be either a gunman or a first-aider (panis, isipin niyo na lang kung bakit, whahahahaha).
